# Me Don't Like Facebook

This is a Chrome Extension to remove Facebook “Like” links for posts, comments etc. The idea is based on [Elan Morgan](https://twitter.com/schmutzie)’s [experiment](https://medium.com/@schmutzie/i-quit-liking-things-on-facebook-for-two-weeks-heres-how-it-changed-my-view-of-humanity-29b5102abace).

You can install [Me Don't Like Facebook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/me-dont-like-facebook/bmfmhgphkcjimmedkhpmnolndnicogla) from Chrome Web Store.

Basically what does the job is the code in `init.coffee` - a few lines of [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) which are compiled and minified into `init.min.js`.
